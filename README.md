# Excel vs Python Project
This repo contains the Excel vs Python comparison project as part of my Data Science portfolio. The project explains the benefits and shortcomings of using Microsoft Excel and Python for data analysis. It also look at the steps and codes to perform data analysis tasks using Excel and Python. By comparing the steps required to perform the same tasks using both Excel and Python, users will have a clearer picture as to the complexity of each tool and decide for themselves which tool is more suitable for their daily uses.  

## Dataset
The Excel version used in this comparison project is Microsoft Excel 2016, while the Python library be used is pandas which is an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. Python's pandas library has a data structure called DataFrame which is the equivalent of an Excel spreadsheet with rows, columns, and indices. In this comparison, we will look at two dataset in CSV (comma-separated values) file format. The first dataset contains all students' personal information and the second dataset contains their examination scores. The data are hypothetical and were generated for the sole purpose of creating this project.
